#Installation

composer install

yarn install

docker-compose up [starts laravel and mysql (mariadb) containers]

Inside laravel container, open terminal, run migrations

Inside another container terminal, run yarn dev to start vite

phpstan, unit tests, pint can all be run adhoc locally (look into how this can be automated)
